# 4A_intern_interface

We have interface_bis which is the main program for the interface, with two files wind1_bis and wind2_bis for the first and second window. 

Furthermore, to run this code you need to download the three images : openBCI (for the logo), banniere (for the first page) and head_1... for the image of the window 1. 
You need to change the direction like in the link and the logo. Also you need to have the event.csv and data.csv
